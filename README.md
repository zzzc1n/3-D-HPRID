# 3DRIED
A High-Resolution 3-D Millimeter-Wave Radar Dataset Dedicated to Imaging and Evaluation (3DRIED) contains two different types of data patterns, which are the raw echo data and the imaging results, respectively, wherein 81 high-quality raw echo data are presented mainly for near-field safety inspection. These targets cover dangerous metal objects such as knives and guns. Free environments and concealed environments are considered in experiments. Visualization results are presented with corresponding 2D and 3D images. For 3DRIED, the resolution of millimeter-wave radar images is as follows: 2.8mm, 2.8mm, 3.75cm.
